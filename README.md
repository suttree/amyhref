## Just the links, ma'am

An AI that lived in your inbox, read all your newsletters and posted them to a feed for you to read later, if ever.

Used machine learning to 'learn' what stories were desired, and what was spam. Opened up insights about the stories shared across different newsletters, and the popularity of content in particular.
